<h1 align="center">COMMUNITY RULES & GUIDELINES</h1>
<br /><br />
<p>These are the following rules and guidelines are meant to create a safe and enjoyable environment for everyone in the roleplay scenario. 
<br /><br />
The rules and guidelines are well enforced and are entirely done by our staff team. The definitions of all rules may be enforced without corresponding examples matching the context of a situation. Multiple situation and scenarios have been tested and reviewed by our staff team.  
<br /><br />
Note: To roleplay in the server, please make sure you have a working microphone with a reasonable quality.
<br /><br />
After all, using these rules, our staff are the ones to decide if your actions have gone against our standard of Roleplay or not.
<br /><br />
Always remember. It's not about winning or losing. You can cheer for your character's success but make sure that roleplay is important. It's not always what you expect it to be. Just make sure to enjoy the journey through Roleplay.
<br /><br />
<b>Streamer/Family Friendly</b>
<br /><br />
You must follow below mentioned rules & guidelines laid out in their Terms and Conditions while in the presence of streamers.
<br /><br />
-	YouTube
<br /><br />
-	Twitch
<br /><br />
-	Rooter
<br /><br />
-	Facebook
<br /><br />
Always assume that someone near you might be streaming unless you have reliable information to prove otherwise.
<br /><br />
Don't try to ruin somebody's stream by playing any kind of copyright music or noisy content which might affect the stream. Take permission first, then you are good to go.
<br /><br />
<b>Mature Content</b>
<br /><br />
This server may also contain mature content in private areas. You must be 16 years or older to play and agree to this when playing.
<br /><br />
<b>Roleplay</b>
<br /><br />
Roleplay is the essential term applied and used in the RP scenario. It can be defined as a scenario where you create an imaginary character to play in the city who will have their own strengths and weaknesses. Your character's story consists of backstory from the past, a present time in which you would be playing, and a certain goal for the future roleplay. In this journey, your character will naturally progress by meeting and interacting with like-minded people, making relationships, earning money, and making some friends and some foes. If you want to survive in the city, you will have to adopt smart ways.
<br /><br />
<b>Don't :</b>
<br /><br />
- Post gore, pornography, or other explicit material.
<br /><br />
- Post any personal information about yourself or others.
<br /><br />
- Post into the wrong channels.
<br /><br />
- Harass other members of the community.
<br /><br />
- Act in a toxic or insulting manner; keep the conversation constructive.
<br /><br />
- Spam offensive words, symbols, images, links, or other advertising text.
<br /><br />
- Talk about specific violations of the rules in public channels; open a ticket.
<br /><br />
- Leave the Discord as it will result in automatic roles removal.
<br /><br />
<b>Character Breaking</b>
<br /><br />
Always stay in character. There are other means to speak out-of-character when necessary, but doing it through your character breaks the immersion for yourself and those around you.
Generally, out-of-character topics include but are not limited to referencing rules, reporting another player, or something that doesn't make sense in-world.
<br /><br />
<b>Not Valuing Life (NVL)</b>
<br /><br />
Your character should recognize when their life is, or could be, in danger and act in a way that would result in their good health. Going against orders under clear threat of death or injury without a sure way of retaliation would be considered not valuing your life.
<br /><br />
<b>Fail RP</b>
<br /><br />
We expect you to roleplay properly. Otherwise, you could be considered failing to roleplay. Roleplay is a mutual experience, and failing to consider the other party's perspective could result in failure. Especially, using game mechanics to your advantage whilst ignoring roleplay.
<br /><br />
<b>Fear RP</b>
<br /><br />
While doing Roleplay, you should be aware of your character's safety and life. When your character's life is threatened or is in danger, your character should show some fear and act accordingly for proceed the Roleplay situation. Not showing Fear might lead to failing the situation (Fail RP).
<br /><br />
<b>Solo Fear RP</b>
<br /><br />
As mentioned above, when you are alone and roleplaying, you should be aware of your surroundings and care about your character's safety and well-being.
<br /><br />
Eg: While standing on a tall building, show some fear as you might fall from there and put your character's life in danger.
<br /><br />
<b>Don't :</b>
<br /><br />
Behave as a corrupt law enforcement officer or government official. Whereas corruption is when you go against laws or standard operating procedures and are reasonably using the job or position to aid those actions.
<br /><br />
Behave, move, and place/use (decorations) unrealistically while disregarding roleplay.
<br /><br />
Try to recognize a person by his voice, clothing or appearance while the person face is covered with mask or something (In-Character Meta).
<br /><br />
Disregard happenings that would result in extreme injury or death.
<br /><br />
Force somebody to withdraw money or items from banks, properties, or other secure containers that you cannot otherwise access (Force RP).
<br /><br />
Initiate any kind of bank/store robbery/heist 30 minutes around (before or after) scheduled server restarts.
<br /><br />
Inject yourself into an ongoing situation, especially to steal from the parties involved (3rd Party).
<br /><br />
Randomly, repetitively, and/or completely rob another player of items without roleplay reason. Especially while they are unresponsive (idling/AFK) (Random Looting).
<br /><br />
Shoot a complying hostage unless police are refusing reasonable demands.
<br /><br />
Using an unacceptable character name - it should be realistic and unique.
<br /><br />
Toggle your hood or trunk while inside to avoid being shot.
<br /><br />
Use communication devices such as Phone, Radio etc. while you are down in any situation.
<br /><br />
Place unrealistic or immersive breaking scenes (text or images). Including, but not limited to, text spam, out-of-character information, or other obnoxious imagery.
<br /><br />
Kill, or beat down, locals (NPCs) because they are not buying your drugs, they are giving you poor prices, or they're pulling out their phone.
Commit felonious crimes inside police stations (such as MRPD) or the courthouse. Realistically, these areas would always have a high police presence.
<br /><br />
Take active, on-duty, paramedics or doctors, hostage and kidnap them inside or directly outside hospitals (such as Pillbox). Holding them hostage is fine, but do not remove them from the premises.
<br /><br />
Use a Hunting Rifle to kill NPC's.
<br /><br />
<b>Fake Hostages/Friendly Hostages</b>
<br /><br />
Fake hostages or Friendly hostage are not allowed. A hostage is determined to be fake when they are not taken spontaneously and there is a predetermined arrangement to be, or take, somebody hostage. It should be unreasonable given most circumstances to ever take a member of your own gang hostage. The hostage takers should create some amount of tension and the hostages should be exhibiting fear towards the threat of their situation.
<br /><br />
<b>Power gaming</b>
<br /><br />
Powergaming is an act of using an in-game mechanic, any external information, or a roleplay concept to favour their own character or story, and give them an unfair or unrealistic advantage. Powergaming can take several forms, but it is generally rooted in “playing to win” or a focus on playing the game, instead of honouring the creative roleplay. Playing your character should always be more important than playing the game.
<br /><br />
-	Don't force officers to unlock the doors at banks or other robberies. It makes sense they would have keys to a hospital but not a bank.
<br /><br />
-	Don't have an unhealthy win mentality. There's a difference between trying to win, which you should be doing for healthy conflict roleplay, and forcing the win or doing absolutely everything possible to secure the win. The difference being allowing for build-up and opportunity for the other party.
<br /><br />
<b>Criminal-Leo RP</b>
<br /><br />
A maximum of 5 individuals (excluding Pacific Heist) should actively participate in a criminal activities/code-red.
<br /><br />
In Store Robbery: Maximum 2 individuals, 1 Vehicle, 1 Hostage
<br /><br />
In Fleeca Bank Robbery: Maximum 5 individuals, 1 Vehicle, 1 Hostage
<br /><br />
In Vangelico (Jewellery) Robbery: Maximum 5 individuals, 2 Vehicle, 1 Hostage
<br /><br />
In Pacific Heist: Maximum 6 individuals, 2 Vehicle, 2 Hostages 
<br />
(You can do code-red with 6 people in Pacific Heist) 
<br /><br />
<b>Note : </b> You are not allowed to start a code-red at a Traffic Stop, Store Robbery, Drug Sell, House Robbery.
<br /><br />
Law Enforcement are only allowed a maximum of 10 individuals to respond to a code-red situation. 
<br />
(Except Pacific Heist: 12 individuals allowed)
<br /><br />
In Store Robbery: 4 individuals with 3 unit (1 Standby unit)
<br /><br />
In Fleeca Bank Robbery: 5 individuals with 4 unit (1 Standby unit)
<br /><br />
In Vangelico (Jewellery) Robbery: 5 individuals with 4 unit (1 Standby unit)
<br /><br />
In Pacific Heist: 6 individuals with 5 unit (1 Standby unit)
<br /><br />
<b>Note : </b> Air-1 unit is only allowed in Fleeca, Jewellery and Pacific Robbery
<br /><br />
Otherwise, there is no party limit for the Leo. An unrestricted number of people may roleplay together, and even defend themselves, so long as done in a legal manner. This also applies to community territories.
<br />
Eg: Escort of any Government bodies, guarding any Authority Building etc.
<br /><br />
Note: You can't loot the hostage as your motive as a robber is to loot the bank/store vault, not the hostage. If the hostage is not obeying you, not fearing your presence or threatening you, you are free to loot.
<br /><br />
<b>In-Character Name and Story</b>
<br /><br />
Character name should be realistic and should match the names exists in Real-Life. Name which consists of Bhai, Boss etc. are not allowed at all. Keep that in mind, your character might be affected for unrealistic names leading to your character deletion.
<br /><br />
Your Character Backstory should be realistic and should consists of some content which will your character future Roleplay. Make sure to mention your character backstory which will lead to your character progression.
<br /><br />
Your Character Content should match your backstory and the character progression in the city.
<br /><br />
Eg: Your character backstory consists of a Cop character, so you will progress your character a Police Officer in the City.
<br /><br />
<b>Character Progression</b>
<br /><br />
Your character requires at least 1 week of progression before engaging into any major roleplay like joining any WL jobs, starting criminal activities etc. 
<br /><br />
First, your character should explore the city, get to know about the city and its people, get to know how to earn and live in the city, interact with people and create some friends etc.
<br /><br />
<b>Gunplay over Roleplay</b>
<br /><br />
When presented with the options (roleplay or shoot), the route should be to roleplay. Prematurely resorting to the escalation of force of a weapon may be considered failing the scene (Fail RP).
<br /><br />
Inorganic conflict between gangs. Invalid reasoning for wars might include demanding unreasonable amounts of money or items, petty insults, or other minor occurrences for Gunplay over Roleplay.
<br /><br />
Prematurely escalating an escape attempt to shooting. A criminal party should make every effort to escape without using their weapons. Valid reasoning to escalate might include aggressive police driving, running low on fuel, an overly damaged vehicle, or other immediate threat of being caught.
<br /><br />
This rule also applies to law enforcement, with some further conditions.
<br /><br />
Escalating when there are more than enough opportunity to de-escalate a situation. Including the usage of a Taser or handcuffs, also known as insta-tazing. Always give time for the other party to escape extenuating circumstances; until they become aggravated driving recklessly, pointing weapons (excluding hostages' present), generally being violent, felony stops, etc.
<br /><br />
Failing to match force with force; excluding when higher levels of force make sense, which is written into the standard operating procedures.
<br /><br />
<b>Character Restrictions</b>
<br /><br />
If you are to playing a PD character or EMS character, you can be a member of a gang, but there are certain condition to follow first.
<br /><br />
-	You can't be a Gang Leader if you are having a PD/EMS character
<br /><br />
-	If you are having a gang character, you won't be promoted to higher rank (max rank. Corporal/EMS Paramedic)
<br /><br />
-	A player a civilian/criminal character can apply for 2 Whitelist Jobs.
<br /><br />
-	A player having a gang character can apply for only 1 Whitelist Job.
<br /><br />
<b>Cop Baiting</b>
<br /><br />
Never interrupt an ongoing situation involving police or paramedics unless you are involved in the situation. Don't call for police when you don't need their help, especially when desiring to rob, kidnap, or kill them. Repetitively instigating police officers into a police pursuit is also considered baiting.
<br /><br />
<b>Cop Looting</b>
<br /><br />
The Cop looting is not allowed (for now).
<br /><br />
<b>Criminal Baiting</b>
<br /><br />
Just as a criminal can bait officers, so can officers to criminals. An officer should not approach criminals with the intent of provoking them. This does not include trying to have a normal conversation or the performance of a sting operation. More specifically, don't approach somebody that hasn't committed and is not reasonably suspected to have committed a crime and shit-talk or coerce them in order to arrest them.
<br /><br />
<b>Criminal-Leo Interaction</b>
<br /><br />
Providing a poor interaction while arresting, detaining, or restraining players. While putting another player into a situation where they are anchored by handcuffs or a prison cell, you should provide them with good interaction. Essentially, talk to them, keep them engaged.
<br /><br />
You may kidnap LEOs given there is reasonable RP.
<br /><br />
You may not kidnap an LEO who is already actively RPing in a scenario you are not involved in.
<br /><br />
You may not rob a cop without a valid reason; they are not your loot cows or your personal armoury.
<br /><br />
<b>Stories & Situations</b>
<br /><br />
A situation is essentially a series of events in real-time. An interruption, or break, in one situation, might lead to another situation in the future of the story. A combat situation is considered over after 10 minutes of observable action. For police, that would be when the last standing officer's panic is activated. Any situation may be considered over after 15 minutes of any interaction with the other parties.
<br /><br />
For Criminal scenarios, the situation ends once the cops bring the accused to the Pillbox or the PD for processing/treatment.
<br /><br />
<b>Random Deathmatch/Vehicle Deathmatch (RDM/VDM)</b>
<br /><br />
Killing, or attempting to kill, somebody without a valid reason or a roleplay scenario is considered as random-deathmatch.
<br /><br />
Ramming, killing, or attempting to kill with a vehicle, somebody is considered as vehicle-deathmatch.
<br /><br />
Examples of valid reasoning for RDM/VDM are as follows :
<br /><br />
Initiation where the other party shows an absolute disregard for the demands being given.
<br /><br />
Previous, and recent, interactions between both parties that would justify attempted/murder. Be mindful of the gunplay over roleplay rule when determining your reasoning.
<br /><br />
<b>New Life Rule (NLR)</b>
<br /><br />
Upon respawning at Pillbox, you forget everything that led to your demise. You may only remember the events if you are revived/healed by the EMS. You cannot use the information that you should have forgotten. This includes that you can't return to where the situation occurred, attempting to get revenge on the other party, or going to the police to report the situation. Also you only start or engage into another situation after 15-20 minutes to show your roleplay of the injuries.
<br /><br />
<b>Force Perma </b>
<br /><br />
Killing or trying end someone's character life by force is called force perma, is forbidden; unless there's a long, succulent, roleplay story behind the death, and is required to bring the story to a conclusion.
<br /><br />
<b>Body Dumping </b>
<br /><br />
Dropping somebody in the water or other vacant locations to avoid the consequences of them remembering, also known as water dumping, is forbidden; unless there's a long, succulent, roleplay story behind the dumping, and is required to bring the story to a conclusion.
<br /><br />
<b>Imitating Roleplay</b>
<br /><br />
Imitating anyone's character or roleplaying another character which doesn't match your character's backstory is forbidden.
<br /><br />
Eg: You can't dress like a police officer and perform cop activities.
<br /><br />
<b>Combat Logging </b>
<br /><br />
Logging off or respawning during an active situation without first reaching an agreement with the other party using OOC is considered combat logging. After committing a crime, you must wait 15 minutes prior to logging off.
<br /><br />
<b>Combat Storing </b>
<br /><br />
Combat storing is storing your Vehicle / Cash / Illegal Items whilst you are in an active role-play situation or someone who is attempting to start one.
<br /><br />
Storing your Vehicle / Cash / Illegal Items in an ATM/Stashes whilst you are being followed by someone is not allowed.
<br /><br />
Storing your Vehicle / Cash / Illegal Items in an ATM/Stashes while someone has initiated role-play is not allowed, you will have to wait for at least 5 minutes to be sure that the situation is over.
<br /><br />
Driving your vehicle into the water so that no one else can access it is a bannable offense.
<br /><br />
<b>Chain Robbing </b>
<br /><br />
If any sort of robbery is continuously executed without any time gap and proper progression between the robberies is called Chain Robbing.
<br /><br />
<b>Safe Zone </b>
<br /><br />
These are the certain location which come under Green Zone.
<br /><br />
-	Pillbox
<br /><br />
-	PDM
<br /><br />
-	Mechanic
<br /><br />
In Green Zone, you can't shoot anyone, make hostage, perform criminal activities, hotwire a vehicle and steal.
<br /><br />
These are the certain location which come under Blue Zone.
<br /><br />
-	Police Department
<br /><br />
-	City Hall
<br /><br />
In Blue Zone, you can start a shoot-out, but you need a succulent, role-playing story behind the shoot-out. Although you can make a hostage, it would break the rule of no-fear RP as you are not showing fear to the government.
<br /><br />
These are the certain location which come under Red Zone.
<br /><br />
-	Illegal Territories like Gang Hood, Turf etc.
<br /><br />
-	High Crime rate Area
<br /><br />
In the Red Zone, you should be aware before entering these areas, as it might lead your character into trouble and you will be responsible for it. If you are willing to enter these area, please be aware of Rule NVL (Not Valuing Life).
<br /><br />
<b>Metagaming </b>
<br /><br />
Information obtained out-of-character should not be used to determine your character's actions. Additionally, sharing out-of-character knowledge via in-character mediums is considered metagaming. Discord DMs and Discord channels are OOC unless otherwise stated by Staff/Management. In-character emails are conducted on the website or Discord with being marked as an IC-Mail.
<br /><br />
<b>Stream Sniping </b>
<br /><br />
Watching a live stream of another player and using the information in-character while also playing is considered metagaming. This includes but is not limited to, using information obtained through a stream to direct your character's actions. We don't have to prove you are doing it without any doubt, we just have to believe its happening.
<br /><br />
<b>Interpersonal Characters/Character Mixing </b>
<br /><br />
Your characters cannot know of each other. No kind of interaction between characters is allowed such as, transferring money, items or other assets between your characters either directly or indirectly (through a friend).You can't give a reference of your different character while playing a different character.
<br /><br />
Eg: While playing a Cop character, you can't talk about my criminal character in any ways.
<br /><br />
<b>In-Game Metagaming </b>
<br /><br />
Your character can't recognize a different player through his voice, clothes or appearance while the person is disguised. You should be aware of the rule Character Breaking.
<br /><br />
<b>Roleplay Blurring</b>
<br /><br />
There must be a clear separation between 'in character' (IC) and 'out of character' (OOC) behaviour and knowledge. If your personal feelings begin to bleed into the roleplay, it is advised that you take a break from the server. If you continue to act based on OOC feelings, beliefs, disagreements or other information in character, especially in a toxic manner, we will be forced to remove you from the server. Please remember that your character is not you and anything that happens to your character is not a direct attack on your outside reality.
<br /><br />
The staff can send you on a break at any moment when they feel that the RP is affecting you IRL. It will not be a ban, but it will be a break for your mental benefit.
<br /><br />
<b>Community Disrespect</b>
<br /><br />
Always show respect to members within the community. Including in-game and out-of- game.
<br /><br />
<b>Reports :</b>
<br /><br />
We take player reports very seriously, and one should never be opened out of emotion. Always take time to cool down and consider the situation objectively. If a report is if a report is opened in a distasteful, hostile, hateful, or spiteful manner, then it will be considered community disrespect. This also includes revenge reports, and opening another report for a situation already reviewed; any and all evidence should be presented in the initial report of any given situation as they are looked at as a whole, and sometimes the reporting party will be given warning points (also known as self-reporting).
<br /><br />
<b>Don't :</b>
<br /><br />
Reference major infectious diseases, disasters, suicide, or other real-world issues such as Covid.
<br /><br />
Heckle people afflicted with physical or mental disorders.
<br /><br />
Pee or poo on other people or in front of them.
<br /><br />
<b>IC Toxicity  </b>
<br /><br />
You can be toxic if both the parties agree. If either side is not comfortable with this, you can't continue to be toxic. If both the parties are abusing each other there should be some mutual understanding between them.
<br /><br /> 
If someone is being toxic and you are not comfortable with it, you can let them know in the OOC chat. If the person still continue to be toxic, they will face the consequences.
<br /><br />
<b>OOC Toxicity </b>
<br /><br />
If your out-of-character behaviour is or appears as in a distasteful, hostile, hateful, or abhorrent manner, especially done in repetition, it may be considered 'toxic' or 'fire starting' which is forbidden.
<br /><br />
<b>Offensive Roleplay  </b>
<br /><br />
You must obtain the consent of all parties involved including staff before conducting sexual acts, torture, dismemberment, cannibalism, suicide, abortion, or other extreme acts. For some, roleplay is a way to escape reality, and although everything is 'real' to our characters, we should all make it a world that everybody can enjoy.
<br /><br />
<b>Sexual Harassment</b>
<br /><br />
Unwanted Cat calling, touching, or other sexual advances constitute sexual harassment. Especially when done in repetition when told to stop.
<br /><br />
<b>Hateful Conduct</b>
<br /><br />
Hateful conduct is any conduct that promotes, encourages, or facilitates discrimination, denigration, objectification, harassment, or violence based on the following characteristics, and is strictly prohibited: race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, gender, gender identity, sexual orientation, age, disability, or serious medical condition.
<br /><br />
<b>Cheating, Hacking or Exploiting</b>
<br /><br />
Unauthorized access to the server is considered hacking, using third-party software or mods to obtain an advantage is considered cheating, and abusing systems is considered exploiting. Report exploits immediately instead of abusing it - you could be rewarded, otherwise, you'll be punished when you're found out.
<br /><br />
Mods that we consider giving an unfair advantage include but are not limited to: graphics mods that add significant brightness and contrast during night, particle effects that contrast hit effects such as confetti, or crosshairs.
<br /><br />
<b>Prohibited Roleplay</b>
<br /><br />
<b>Corrupt EMS and PD is strictly not allowed</b>
<br /><br />
<b>Torture RP :</b> If there is consent from both the parties. If either party disagree with it, you can't proceed further forcefully.
<br /><br />
<b>Suicide RP/Permadeath :</b> You should have a strong RP behind it.
<br /><br />
<b>Pregnancy RP :</b> Discuss with Staff Team once.
<br /><br />
<b>Erotic RP :</b> Please keep Streaming Platform(s) Terms and Condition in mind.
<br /><br />
<b>Animal RP :</b>  Prohibited unless authorized by Staff Team.
